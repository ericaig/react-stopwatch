# REACT STOPWATCH 
I made this as a result of a coding challenge I found on Instagram [#codechallengesolved](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQwBL6CjHy/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link).

It made sense to do it using React since at this time, I'm still learning it and making a stopwatch with it was a plausible challenge. So the result you see in this repository is my final result.
